how to use it
if you run the message, and it says "module: pyperclip not found" either change interpreter, or do "pip install pyperclip" in cmd/powershell. If not update python ```python -m pip install --upgrade pip```
## syntax
use "|" in the response, to make the aftertext 2x reversed in html, use 2 and the second won't do anything, other than 3 reversing the after text, honestly just funk around and use a html visualizer to see the text
